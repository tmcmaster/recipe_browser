# Recipe Browser

This Recipe Browser POC was built to demonstrate how to build an app using Riverpod for state management.

It also showcased the use of Hero widgets to transition the plate on the list screen to the recipe description page and back again as something to keep the user's focus while transitioning between pages.

The Shopping list page demonstrated building a more complex component, integrating several user interactions and features.

- Switching into add mode for entering shopping items
- Click an item to edit it
- Drag an item to reorder the list
- Swipe an item left and right to delete it
- Tick when it is done (and untick it to mark it not done)
- Persistence between sessions
