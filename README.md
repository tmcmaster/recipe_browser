# Recipe Browser

I built this POC to demonstrate how to build an app using Riverpod for state management.

It also showcased the use of Hero widgets to transition the plate on the list screen to the 
recipe description page and back again, as something to keep the users focus while transitioning 
between pages.

The Shopping list page was there to demonstrate buuilding a more complex component, integrating a 
number of user interactions and features together.
- Switching into add mode for enter shopping items
- click an item to edit it
- drag an item to reorder the list
- swipe an item left and right to delete it
- tick when it is done (and untick it to mark it not done)
